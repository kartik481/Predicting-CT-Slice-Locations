       " ('Actually, I think it\\'s explainable.   It\\'s wrong to do the clflush *after* the GPU has done the write, which  seems to be what you are doing.   Why?   If the GPU really isn\\'t cache coherent, what can happen is:    - the CPU has the line cached    - the GPU writes the data    - you do the clflushopt to invalidate the cacheline    - you expect to see the GPU data.   Right?   Wrong. The above is complete crap.   Why?   Very simple reason: the CPU may have had the cacheline dirty at some  level in its caches, so when you did the clflushopt, it didn\\'t just  invalidate the CPU cacheline, it wrote it back to memory. And in the  process over-wrote the data that the GPU had written.   Now you can say \"but the CPU never wrote to the cacheline, so it\\'s not  dirty in the CPU caches\". That may or may not be trie. The CPU may  have written to it quite a long time ago.   So if you are doing a GPU write, and you want to see the data that the  GPU wrote, you had better do the clflushopt long *before* the GPU ever  writes to memory.   Your pattern of doing \"flush and read\" is simply fundamentally buggy.  There are only two valid CPU flushing patterns:    - write and flush (to make the writes visible to the GPU)    - flush before starting GPU accesses, and then read   At no point can \"flush and read\" be right.   Now, I haven\\'t actually seen your code, so I\\'m just going by your  high-level description of where the CPU flush and CPU read were done,  but it *sounds* like you did that invalid \"flush and read\" behavior.

And while the xchg into  the redzoen wouldn\\'t be acceptable as a real implementation, for  timing testing it\\'s likely fine (ie you aren\\'t hitting the problem it  can cause).   Note that we never actually *use* lfence/sfence. They are pointless  instructions when looking at CPU memory ordering, because for pure CPU  memory ordering stores and loads are already ordered.   The only reason to use lfence/sfence is after you\\'ve used nontemporal  stores for IO. That\\'s very very rare in the kernel. So I wouldn\\'t  worry about those.   But yes, it does sound like mfence is just a bad idea too.   No.   I think the only issue is that there has never been any real reason  for CPU designers to try to make mfence go particularly fast. Nobody  uses it, again with the exception of some odd loops that use  nontemporal stores, and for those the cost tends to always be about  the nontemporal accesses themselves (often to things like GPU memory  over PCIe), and the mfence cost of a few extra cycles is negligible.   The reason \"lock ; add $0\" has generally been the fastest we\\'ve found  is simply that locked ops have been important for CPU designers.

So what I am saying is simple: anybody who writes that  \"smp_read_barrier_depends()\" in there is just ttoally and completely  WRONG, and the fact that Peter wrote it out after I removed several  instances of that bloody f*cking idiocy is disturbing.

It inevitably only exposes a subset of what different  people would want.   Making \"aio_read()\" and friends a special interface had historical  reasons for it. But expanding willy-nilly on that model does not.                  ',),\n",
       " ('So I think this is ridiculously ugly.   AIO is a horrible ad-hoc design, with the main excuse being \"other,  less gifted people, made that design, and we are implementing it for  compatibility because database people - who seldom have any shred of  taste - actually use it\".   But AIO was always really really ugly.   Now you introduce the notion of doing almost arbitrary system calls  asynchronously in threads, but then you use that ass-backwards nasty  interface to do so.   Why?   If you want to do arbitrary asynchronous system calls, just *do* it.  But do _that_, not \"let\\'s extend this horrible interface in arbitrary  random ways one special system call at a time\".   In other words, why is the interface not simply: \"do arbitrary system  call X with arguments A, B, C, D asynchronously using a kernel  thread\".   That\\'s something that a lot of people might use. In fact, if they can  avoid the nasty AIO interface, maybe they\\'ll even use it for things  like read() and write().   So I really think it would be a nice thing to allow some kind of  arbitrary \"queue up asynchronous system call\" model.   But I do not think the AIO model should be the model used for that,  even if I think there might be some shared infrastructure.   So I would seriously suggest:    - how about we add a true \"asynchronous system call\" interface    - make it be a list of system calls with a futex completion for each  list entry, so that you can easily wait for the end result that way.    - maybe (and this is where it gets really iffy) you could even pass  in the result of one system call to the next, so that you can do  things like          fd = openat(..)         ret = read(fd, ..)      asynchronously and then just wait for the read() to complete.   and let us *not* tie this to the aio interface.   In fact, if we do it well, we can go the other way, and try to  implement the nasty AIO interface on top of the generic \"just do  things asynchronously\".   And I actually think many of your kernel thread parts are good for a  generic implementation. That whole \"AIO_THREAD_NEED_CRED\" etc logic  all makes sense, although I do suspect you could just make it  unconditional. The cost of a few atomics shouldn\\'t be excessive when  we\\'re talking \"use a thread to do op X\".   What do you think? Do you think it might be possible to aim for a  generic \"do system call asynchronously\" model instead?   I\\'m adding Ingo the to cc, because I think Ingo had a \"run this list  of system calls\" patch at one point - in order to avoid system call  overhead. I don\\'t think that was very interesting (because system call  overhead is seldom all that noticeable for any interesting system  calls), but with the \"let\\'s do the list asynchronously\" addition it  might be much more intriguing. Ingo, do I remember correctly that it  was you? I might be confused about who wrote that patch, and I can\\'t  find it now.                  ',),\n",

I already removed a  number of bogus cases of it, and I removed the incorrect documentation  that had this crap.   It\\'s called \"smp_READ_barrier_depends()\" for a reason.   Alpha is the only one that needs it, and alpha needs it only for  dependent READS.   It\\'s not called smp_read_write_barrier_depends(). It\\'s not called  \"smp_mb_depends()\". It\\'s a weaker form of \"smp_rmb()\", nothing else.   So alpha does have an implied dependency chain from a read to a  subsequent dependent write, and does not need any extra barriers.   Alpha does *not* have a dependency chain from a read to a subsequent  read, which is why we need that horrible crappy  smp_read_barrier_depends(). But it\\'s the only reason.   This is the alpha reference manual wrt read-to-write dependency:     5.6.1.7 Definition of Dependence Constraint       The depends relation (DP) is defined as follows. Given u and v  issued by processor Pi, where u      is a read or an instruction fetch and v is a write, u precedes v  in DP order (written u DP v, that      is, v depends on u) in either of the following situations:        √¢ u determines the execution of v, the location accessed by v, or  the value written by v.       √¢ u determines the execution or address or value of another  memory access z that precedes       v or might precede v (that is, would precede v in some execution  path depending      on the value read by u) by processor issue constraint (see Section 5.6.1.3).   Note that the dependence barrier honors not only control flow, but  address and data values too.  This is a different syntax than we use,  but \\'u\\' is the READ_ONCE, and \\'v\\' is the write. Any data, address or  conditional dependency between the two implies an ordering.   So no, \"smp_read_barrier_depends()\" is *ONLY* about two reads, where  the second read is data-dependent on the first. Nothing else.   So if you _ever_ see a \"smp_read_barrier_depends()\" that isn\\'t about a  barrier between two reads, then that is a bug.   The above code is crap.
